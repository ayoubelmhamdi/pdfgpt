## Definition

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on learning data representations, rather than specific task algorithms. It uses hidden layers of artificial neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, and complex propositional calculations. 

## Explanation

Deep learning is a method of teaching computers to learn and understand patterns in data. Instead of explicitly programming the computer with specific instructions, deep learning algorithms allow the computer to learn on its own by analyzing large amounts of data. This is done by using artificial neural networks, which are designed to mimic the way the human brain works. These networks have multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process and analyze the data. Each layer of neurons learns to recognize different features or patterns in the data, and the information is passed from one layer to the next until a final output is produced. This process is called deep learning because the networks have many layers, allowing them to learn complex representations of the data. 

## Example

An example of deep learning is training a computer to recognize images of cats. Instead of explicitly telling the computer what a cat looks like, deep learning algorithms can analyze thousands of images of cats and learn to recognize common features, such as pointy ears and whiskers. Once the computer has learned these features, it can then use them to identify cats in new images that it has never seen before. This ability to learn from data and make accurate predictions is what makes deep learning so powerful and versatile.

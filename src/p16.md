## Example of Deep Learning in Practice

To understand the relationship between artificial neural networks and linear functions, let's use the example of temperature conversion. 

A linear function is a type of mathematical function that describes a simple relationship between two variables, where a change in one variable results in a proportional change in the other. For example, if we have a function that converts Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit, this function would be linear because every increase of one degree Celsius results in a constant increase in Fahrenheit temperature. 

For instance, if we have a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, we can use a linear function to convert it to Fahrenheit.

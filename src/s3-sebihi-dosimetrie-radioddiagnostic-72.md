# Dosimetry in Radiodiagnosis

## Introduction
Radiological detriment from a procedure is related to the effective dose.
- Review of basic dose indicators and measurement methods.
Estimation of the effective dose.
- Example of effective doses in radiodiagnosis.
Although the doses administered in medical imaging are generally low, some exams can cause significant harm.
We will see:
- Dose indicators,
- Means of measurement,
- How to use them to determine organ doses and effective dose.

## Why determine the dose?
Knowing the absorbed dose from radiation in a patient undergoing a diagnostic procedure is essential for evaluating the radiological detriment of the procedure.
- Medical exposure is the primary artificial source of population exposure.
- Radiological practice is constantly evolving (CT scans, ...).
- Equipment is often poorly adjusted and used.
- For low doses, radiation dermatitis can appear long after exposure.
- Recommendations and legislation exist to reduce patient doses.

## Results of the CEC 1991 survey
An international survey in 16 countries/83 departments was conducted by 15 radiology experts for quality control and measurement of entrance surface dose.
CONCLUSION: Large dispersion of doses for comparable quality!

## Detriment - Effective dose
Exposure to radiation in different tissues and organs results in different probabilities of different severities.
This combination is called "Detriment".
- The effective dose is the quantitative representation of the radiological detriment.
- E: effective dose
- w: weighting factor for organ or tissue T
- H: equivalent dose to organ or tissue T
- The effective dose is not "measurable"!

Dose profile for a slice
For each slice, the
received dose is the sum
of these 2 parts.
Nominal slice thickness. Ideally,
it corresponds to the width of the detector
(D).
Only the part between the two half-lines
participates in the formation of
the image.
The penumbra (black) on either side
of the slice does not contribute
to the image but is an integral
part of the received dose.
Dosimetric quantity - CTDI
The Computed Tomographic Dose Index (CTDI) is equal
to the integral of the dose profile (D(z)), for a single slice,
calculated along the (z) axis representing the rotation axis
of the scanner, divided by the nominal slice thickness (T).

## Dosimetry in Mammography
Average Glandular Dose (AGD)
The recommended dosimetric quantity for assessing radiation risk is the Average Glandular Dose.
AGD (mGy)
AGD cannot be directly measured but is determined through measurements on phantoms.
The entrance dose (to the breast), KASE, (ESAK: Entrance Surface Air Kerma) is the quantity used to determine the dose in mammography.
69
AGD is expressed using conversion factors obtained through Monte Carlo calculations:
AGD = KASE * g * c * s
g = factor that converts KASE to AGD delivered to the breast.
Radiation Dosimetry in Radiodiagnosis

The calculations for this factor were done using a reference spectrum of Mo/Mo and a standard breast represented by a half-cylindrical phantom with a diameter of 16 cm. The center of the phantom is composed of 50% fatty tissue and 50% glandular tissue, and the periphery is covered by a 5 mm layer of fatty tissue.

This factor depends on the compressed breast thickness (ranging from 2 to 11 cm) and the CDA (ranging from 0.30 to 0.60 mm of Al).

DGM = KASE * g * c * s

c: a factor that takes into account the differences in breast composition based on its compressed thickness.
s: a coefficient that considers the influence of beam quality on g, with different values depending on the spectrum used:
- s = 1 for Mo/Mo
- s = 1.017 for Mo/Rh
- s = 1.042 for W/Rh
- s = 1.061 for RWWRh
- s = 1.044 for RWAl

DGM is displayed for each exposure in digital mammography.
DGM is provided by charts based on exposure parameters and breast thickness in analog mammography.

Entrance dose (D,) is 10 mGy per incidence for an average breast, which corresponds to a DGM of 2.5 mGy.

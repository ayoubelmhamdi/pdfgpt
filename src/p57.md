## Definition

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on learning data representations, rather than specific task algorithms. It uses hidden layers of artificial neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, and complex propositional calculus computations.

## Explanation

Deep learning is a method of teaching computers to learn and understand data. Instead of telling the computer exactly what to look for, deep learning allows the computer to learn on its own by analyzing patterns and relationships in the data. It does this by using artificial neural networks, which are like virtual brains made up of interconnected nodes. These networks have hidden layers that help the computer process and understand complex information.

For example, let's say we want to teach a computer to recognize images of cats. In traditional machine learning, we would have to manually program the computer with specific features to look for, such as the shape of the ears or the color of the fur. But with deep learning, we can simply feed the computer a large dataset of cat images and let it figure out the important features on its own. The computer will learn to recognize cats by analyzing the patterns and relationships in the data.

Deep learning is used in many applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. It has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and has led to significant advancements in technology.

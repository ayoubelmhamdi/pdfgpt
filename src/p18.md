## Example of Deep Learning in Practice

To understand the relationship between artificial neural networks and linear functions, let's use the example of temperature conversion.

A linear function is a type of mathematical function that describes a simple relationship between two variables, where a change in one variable results in a proportional change in the other variable. For example, if we have a function that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, this function would be linear because every increase of one degree Celsius results in a constant increase in temperature in Fahrenheit.

For instance, if we have a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, we can use a linear function to convert it to Fahrenheit. The linear function would take the Celsius temperature as input and output the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.

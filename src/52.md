## Example of Deep Learning in Practice

To understand the relationship between artificial neural networks and linear functions, let's take the example of temperature conversion.

A linear function is a type of mathematical function that describes a simple relationship between two variables, where a change in one variable leads to a proportional change in the other variable. For example, if we have a function that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, this function would be linear because every increase of one degree Celsius results in a constant increase in temperature in Fahrenheit.

For instance, if we have a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, we can use a linear function to convert it to Fahrenheit by multiplying it by 1.8 and adding 32. So, the conversion would be:

Fahrenheit = (20 * 1.8) + 32 = 68 + 32 = 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

In this example, the linear function allows us to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using a simple mathematical relationship. This concept is important in deep learning because artificial neural networks can learn to approximate complex functions, including linear functions, by adjusting their weights and biases.

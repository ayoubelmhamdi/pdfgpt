## Example of Deep Learning in Practice

To understand the relationship between artificial neural networks and linear functions, let's use the example of temperature conversion.

A linear function is a type of mathematical function that describes a simple relationship between two variables, where a change in one variable results in a proportional change in the other. For example, if we have a function that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, this function would be linear because every increase of one degree Celsius results in a constant increase in temperature in Fahrenheit.

For instance, if we have a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, we can use a linear function to convert it to Fahrenheit. The linear function would be something like:

Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32

By plugging in the value of 37 for Celsius, we can calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit:

Fahrenheit = (37 * 9/5) + 32 = 98.6

In this example, the linear function allows us to convert the temperature from one scale to another using a simple mathematical relationship. This is just one application of linear functions in the real world.

By understanding the concept of linear functions, we can better grasp the connection between artificial neural networks and their ability to learn and make predictions based on patterns and relationships in data.
